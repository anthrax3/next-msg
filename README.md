# next-msg
If youâ€™re tired of over engineered tooltips, then this is for you, clean and simple.

````javascript
$("#btSubmit").nextMsg({ msg:"Tool-tip text goes here", CSSClass: "nextMsg-DarkTheme" });
````

This jQuery plugin creates popup tooltip messages next to the selected element. All theming is controlled using css, no images are used! Included in the zip is a demo and some screenshots.

## Browser Support
IE 7+, Google Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Opera 

## Themes
The css provides some canned themes that you can use. But you can always make your own.
